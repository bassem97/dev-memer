# Random Memer

Flask API to return random programming meme images scrapped from :
 - [Memedroid](https://www.memedroid.com/memes/tag/programming).
 - [cometchat](https://www.cometchat.com/blog/programming-memes-for-developers).
 - [testbytes](https://www.testbytes.net/blog/programming-memes/).

To use just send a GET request to http://dev-memer.info/

You can also use this with `img` tag in your website and it will display a random meme everytime the website is loaded

```html
<img src='http://http://dev-memer.info/' title="Meme" alt="Please refresh the page if the meme doesn't show up.">
```
