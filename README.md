# Random Memer

Flask API to return random programming meme images scrapped from :
 - [Memedroid](https://www.memedroid.com/memes/tag/programming).
 - [cometchat](https://www.cometchat.com/blog/programming-memes-for-developers).
 - [testbytes](https://www.testbytes.net/blog/programming-memes/).

To use just send a GET request to [https://random-memeer.herokuapp.com/](https://random-memeer.herokuapp.com/)

You can also use this with `img` tag in your website and it will display a random meme everytime the website is loaded

```html
<img src='https://random-memer.herokuapp.com/' title="Meme" alt="Please refresh the page if the meme doesn't show up.">
```

The API is deployed on the free dyno provided by Heroku, which shuts-down if there is no request to it for some time, so sometimes it might take some time to load the image from the URL.
